Face Recognition Using Siamese Neural Network


Project Title: Siamese Network-based Face Recognition System

Project Description:
The Siamese Network-based Face Recognition System is an advanced computer vision project that utilizes deep learning techniques to recognize and verify individuals' faces. The system employs a Siamese network architecture, which is known for its effectiveness in learning similarity between input pairs. By training the network on a dataset of labeled face images, the system can learn to distinguish between different individuals and accurately identify them in real-time scenarios.

Key Features:

Face Data Collection: The system allows users to collect positive and anchor face images using their device's camera. This step involves capturing multiple images of individuals to build a robust training dataset.

Data Augmentation: To enhance the training dataset, the system applies various data augmentation techniques such as random transformations (flipping, rotation, scaling), contrast adjustment, and brightness changes to the positive images. This augmentation process helps improve the model's generalization capabilities.

Preprocessing and Data Partitioning: The collected face images are preprocessed by resizing them and scaling the pixel values between 0 and 1. The data is then split into training and testing partitions to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

Siamese Network Architecture: The core of the system is the Siamese network, which consists of an embedding layer and a distance layer. The embedding layer extracts meaningful features from input face images, while the distance layer calculates the L1 distance between the embeddings of anchor and validation images.

Training and Evaluation: The Siamese network is trained using the training partition of the face images. The model is optimized using the binary cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer. After training, the system evaluates the model's performance on the testing partition, measuring metrics such as precision and recall.

Real-Time Face Verification: The trained model is used for real-time face verification. When provided with an input face image, the system compares it with the stored verification images to determine if they belong to the same person. This process involves calculating detection and verification thresholds to make accurate identity judgments.

User-Friendly Interface: The project includes a user-friendly interface that allows easy interaction with the system. Users can initiate face data collection, capture input images, and perform real-time face verification through intuitive commands.

Model Persistence: The trained Siamese network model can be saved and loaded for future use. This feature ensures that the system retains learned knowledge and eliminates the need for retraining.
